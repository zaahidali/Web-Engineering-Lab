### 4) Table Creation (using rows, cols and color as input and dynamically creating a table)
- Created an HTML page that takes 3 input from the user i.e. a row size, a column size and a color picker. Once the user submits the given input, the JS code would create a table dynamically with the specified number of rows and columns and the specified color set as background color.
